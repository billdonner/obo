## Flashcard Concept

Questions are personalized per player (cousin). Each player gets questions oriented to their perspective:

- **Tier 1 (Easy, ages 3-5)**: "What is Poobah's real name?" / "Who are the twins?"
- **Tier 2 (Medium, ages 5-8)**: "What is May May's maiden name?" / "Which uncle is the oldest?"
- **Tier 3 (Hard, ages 8-12)**: "Who is Bryce's father?" / relationship chain questions
- **Tier 4 (Expert, ages 10+)**: "Name all cousins oldest to youngest" / family trivia
